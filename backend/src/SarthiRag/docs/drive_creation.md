## **Detailed "Drive Creation" Workflow**

The "Drive Creation" sidebar is the most critical feature. Saarthi must guide HRs through every sub-step meticulously.

### **Phase 1: Basic Job Identity**

* **Job ID Entry:** A mandatory unique identifier. Best practice suggests conventions like ROLE\_LOC\_YEAR\_001.  
* **Role & Headcount:** Specify the Job Title (e.g., "Java Developer") and the total target headcount.  
* **Job Type Categorization:**  
  * **Internship:** Requires the HR to enter a specific **Duration** (e.g., 3–12 months).  
  * **Full Time:** Standard permanent employment.  
  * **Contractual:** Requires specifying the contract length and extension possibilities.

### **Phase 2: Candidate Requirements**

* **Experience Tier:**  
  * **Fresher:** Targeted at 0–1 year of experience.  
  * **Experienced:** HR must define both **Minimum** and **Maximum** years of experience.  
* **Skill Mapping:** Input primary skills (mandatory) and secondary skills. Saarthi should suggest comma-separated lists for better AI parsing (e.g., "React JS, Node JS, AWS").

### **Phase 3: Assessment Round Configuration**

HR can add multiple rounds in a custom sequence:

* **Resume Screening:** AI-powered semantic matching with a minimum score threshold.  
* **Coding Rounds:** HR enters the number of questions, difficulty, and the **full text of the problem statements**.  
* **Technical Interview:** AI-conducted video/audio assessment with specific evaluation rubrics.  
* **HR / Cultural Fit:** Behavioral assessments conducted by AI or assisted by HR.

### **Phase 4: Logistics & Activation**

* **Timeline:** Set specific **Start** and **End** dates for the drive application window.  
* **Location:** Define the work site (e.g., "Remote," "Hybrid," or specific city).  
* **Resume Ingestion:**  
  * **Single Upload:** PDF or DOCX format.  
  * **Bulk Folder:** Uploading a .zip file containing multiple resumes.  
* **Submission:** Once submitted, the drive card is created and the application link is activated.
